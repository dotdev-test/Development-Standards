# Code Guidelines

Since we use many different languages we have adopted the preferred industry standard guidelines.

This is to ensure a consistent format across projects and improve developer comfort.

## General Development Guidelines

* "Explicit is better than implicit"
* "Readability counts. Don't assume I can read your code"
* "Anybody can fix anything."
* Fix each broken window (bad design, wrong decision, or poor code) as soon as it is discovered.
* "Now is better than never."&#x20;
* Test ruthlessly. Write docs for new features.
* These guidelines may--and probably will--change.

## Javascript

Standard used: [standard JS](https://standardjs.com)

Notes:

* We have a preference for ES6 modular development.&#x20;
* Each project needs to include [eslint](http://eslint.org)
* Follow the [jsDoc](http://usejsdoc.org) standard
* Two space tabs!

## PHP

Standard used: [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)

Notes:

* All new projects should be built on PHP 7 with backward compatibility to 5.6 only if needed.

## Python

Standard used: [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

Notes:

* The minimum version should be 3.5
* Always use [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to manage pip.

## C\\

Standard used: [C# Coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
