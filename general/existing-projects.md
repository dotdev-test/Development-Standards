# Existing Projects

When working on exisitng projects **do not** work off the master branch. Fork and create your own branch.

If the project does not have a `changelog.md` create one following the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/) guidelines.

When ready to merge to production create a pull request and work with your lead\
to manage the process.
